## Akita Adventures Automated Vacation Advertising system

> A proof of concept project to automate the harnessing of weather data to promote vacation flights from gloomy cities to sunny cities, powered by HarperDB

Akita Adventures is a vacation planning company helping people explore the world by promoting Terrier Airlines deals via Web and Social Media ads-- promoting flights to Sunny cities to audiences in cities with Gloomy weather.

Saluki Solutions has been retained to develop a Proof of Concept project, using HarperDB, to forecast the weather of major American cities and promote flights to cities with Sunny weather forecasts to audiences in cities with overcast, rainy, or snowy weather forecasts. Ultimately, flights could be substituted with hotel deals, or vacation packages if this project were to be expanded.

### Start it up ðŸš€

- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/pmeaney/automated-vacation-advertising-system.git`
- Run the project with docker-compose: `docker compose up`

### API Used

- **OpenWeatherMaps**
  - Docs:
    - [5-day forecast API](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5)
    - The OpenWeatherMaps API structure is convenient as a developer, because it offers codified weather status codes-- Sort of like how http status codes include broad groups and specific codes (i.e. 2XX vs 200 codes), the API offers for example, "Group 2xx: Thunderstorm", vs "201 Thunderstorm Description: thunderstorm with rain", or "202 Thunderstorm Description: thunderstorm with heavy rain"
      - You can find those weather code IDs here: https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions

### Loading CSV Files locally via Operations API

- To setup a Cities data table, we will load data from a CSV file into HarperDB.
  - We'll need to add a data volume to share with our harperdb docker container: `- ./data-for-hdb:/home/harperdb/hdb/data-for-hdb` in docker-compose.yml
  - We'll download a csv file into a new directory we create called `data-for-hdb`. The example csv file in this case is a list of the top 1000 US cities by population, from a repo by Plotly, at: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/us-cities-top-1k.csv
- We then create some http requests to our HarperDB Application.
- We also set up a query to take a look at some sample data to make sure our table looks as we expect it to.
  - **Note**:
    - table primary keys are created automatically (as is common with table migration tools)
    - keys are created as unique ids, rather than a series of numbers (e.g. 1, 2, 3)

```bash
###
# Create citiesPopList table so we can load data into it.
curl -X POST "http://localhost:9925/" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Basic SERCX0FETUlOOnBhc3N3b3Jk" \
     -d '{
           "operation": "create_table",
           "table": "citiesPopList",
           "primary_key": "id"
         }'

###
# Import Cities & Population csv file via Operations API
# Data source: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/us-cities-top-1k.csv
curl -X POST "http://localhost:9925/" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Basic SERCX0FETUlOOnBhc3N3b3Jk" \
     -d '{
           "operation": "csv_file_load",
           "action": "insert",
           "database": "data",
           "table": "citiesPopList",
           "file_path": "/home/harperdb/hdb/data-for-hdb/us-cities-top-1k.csv"
         }'

###
# Check our table
# SELECT * FROM data.citiesPopList LIMIT 10
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9926/application-template/check_citiesPopList" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Basic SERCX0FETUlOOnBhc3N3b3Jk"
```

Yep! The new table exists now!

```json

    "id": "823febfe-6c79-4114-bb80-75e6552b08e6",
    "City": "New York",

    "State": "New York",
